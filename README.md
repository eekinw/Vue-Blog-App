A homepage displaying a list of blog posts with their titles and summaries.
A blog post detail page, showing the full content of a post and its comments.
A form to submit new comments for a specific blog post.
A navigation bar for routing between the homepage and blog post detail pages.


Here's how each requirement can be practiced in this application:

props: Pass the blog post data as a prop from the parent component (e.g., homepage or blog post detail page) to the child component (e.g., a blog post preview or a comment component).

emits: Emit custom events from child components to parent components. For example, when a new comment is submitted using the form, emit an event from the comment form component to the blog post detail component to update the list of comments.

routing: Use Vue Router to handle navigation between the homepage and blog post detail pages. Create routes for these pages and use router-link components for navigation.

ref: Use ref to create reactive variables for storing the list of blog posts, the selected blog post, and the new comment text.

Here's a high-level structure for the Blog application:

Create a BlogPostPreview component that displays a blog post's title and summary. This component will receive the blog post data as a prop.

Create a BlogPost component that displays the full content of a blog post and its comments. This component will also receive the blog post data as a prop.

Create a Comment component to display an individual comment. This component will receive the comment data as a prop.

Create a CommentForm component that includes a form to submit new comments. This component will emit an event when a new comment is submitted.

Create a Navbar component for navigation between the homepage and blog post detail pages.

Set up Vue Router with routes for the homepage and blog post detail pages.

In the homepage component, use a v-for loop to render the BlogPostPreview component for each blog post.

In the blog post detail component, render the BlogPost component, the Comment components for each comment, and the CommentForm component.

By building this simple Blog application, you'll gain hands-on experience with Vue 3 features like props, emits, routing, and ref.
